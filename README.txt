The ACCURAT Consortium welcomes you to the ACCURAT Toolkit's download site.
The consortium is pleased to offer you a set of tools for comparable corpora collection, analysis and data extraction from comparable corpora. We hope that our contribution to the public community (you included) will be helpful to you and will allow for you to achieve your goals. We welcome also feedback and suggestions on possibilities for improvement of the tools.

The tools are released under Apache 2.0 License: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html

The ACCURAT Toolkit consists of tools published as part of two deliverables:
	1) Deliverable D2.6 Toolkit for multi-level alignment and information extraction from comparable corpora (Version 3).
	2) Deliverable D3.5 Tools for building comparable corpus from the Web (Version 3).

In order for You to receive the tools you are searching for, we have created several archives. You do not have to download all of them as the archives are redundant and if You will download everything You will end up having at least two copies of every tool!

Therefore, for the tools in the Deliverable D2.6:
	1) Download the "ACCURAT D2.6 Toolkit for multi-level alignment and information extraction from comparable corpora v3.0.pdf" document, which is the DOCUMENTATION (USER MANUAL) of the tools included in D2.6.
	2) Download the "D2_6_Section_1_GeneralWorkflows.zip" if You wish only to use the workflows and/or are not interested in separate tools. The archive contains the WORKFLOWS defined in Section 1 of the DOCUMENTATION. All ACCURAT Toolkit tools required by the workflows are already bundled, therefore, if You are not interested in complete source code or excess sample data download only this archive.
	2) Download the "D2_6_Section_2_to_6_Tools.zip" if You are interested in multiple tools from the ACCURAT toolkit and You also want to make use of additional features of the tools that are not accessible in the WORKFLOWS. This archive contains all separate ACCURAT Toolkit's tools with all sample data. Some of the tools also contain source code that was not included in the WORKFLOWS.
